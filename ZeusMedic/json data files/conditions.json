[{"id":1,"condition":"Pneumonia","description":"Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia. Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening.

Most cases are infectious, although gastroenteritis may occur after ingestion of drugs and chemical toxins (eg, metals, plant substances).

Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Diagnosis is clinical or by stool culture, although polymerase chain reaction testing and immunoassays are increasingly used. Treatment is symptomatic, although some parasitic and some bacterial infections require specific anti-infective therapy.","image":"","duration1":80,"duration2":20,"duration3":20,"age1":90,"age2":50,"age3":50,"male":50,"female":50,"weightLoss":30,"nightSweats":20,"fatigue":40,"noAppetite":90,"fever":90,"chills":90,"visualChanges":0,"headaches":0,"eyePain":0,"doubleVision":0,"runnyNose":0,"noseBleed":0,"sinusPain":0,"stuffyEars":0,"ringingInEars":0,"soreThroat":0,"painWithSwallowing":0,"bleedingGums":0,"chestPain":0,"shortnessOfBreath":0,"exerciseIntolerance":0,"cantSleep":0,"swellingInAnkles":0,"palpitations":0,"cough":0,"sputum":0,"coughingBlood":0,"wheezing":0,"bloodInStools":40,"cantEat":20,"vomiting":50,"bloating":90,"nausea":90,"cramping":90,"constipation":20,"blackStools":20,"diarrhea":120,"vomitingBlood":1,"indigestion":50,"difficultySwallowing":0,"abdominalPain":30,"heavyMenses":0,"cantPee":0,"difficultyPeeing":0,"incontinence":0,"bloodInUrine":0,"frequentUrination":0,"weakUrineStream":0,"poorBalance":0,"changesInSmell":0,"changesInSight":0,"changesInTaste":0,"changesInHearing":0,"seizures":0,"faint":0,"cantMovePartOfBody":0,"numbness":0,"painsAndNeedles":0,"passingOut":0,"speechProblems":0,"breastDischarge":0,"breastSore":0,"breastSwelling":0,"breastPain":0,"irregularMenses":0,"frequentMenses":0,"vaginalDischarge":0,"noMenses":0,"lightMenses":0,"itchy":0,"rashes":0,"lump":0,"eczema":0,"discoloration":0,"pain":0,"morningStiffness":0,"jointSwelling":0,"decreasedRangeOfMotion":0,"crepitus":0,"arthritis":0}]
